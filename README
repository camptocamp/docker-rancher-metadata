Standalone rancher-metadata docker image mapped on releases from
https://github.com/rancher/rancher-metadata/releases

Useful to test interaction with the rancher-metadata service outside of a
proper Rancher installation.

Copy /var/lib/cattle/etc/cattle/metadata/answers.yml from a running
rancher/agent-instance container, then execute something along these lines:

docker run -it -v $PWD:/answers/ camptocamp/rancher-metadata:v0.5.1 -answers /answers/answers.yml
